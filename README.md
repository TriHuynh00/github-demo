# Github Instruction Project

This repository is created to demonstrate the github features to students learning Information Technology and Software Engineering courses in RMIT.

The following features will be demonstrated in this project:

## Create and clone a repository

### Cloning a repository

When you or your teammate creates a repository on the GitHub website, that repository exists in the GitHub server but not on our computer. We need to clone the repository into a folder to "download" the GitHub repository into a machine. The command to clone is as follows:

clone http://<repository_url>

Clicking the "<> Code" button on the repository home page shows the repository_url, as illustrated in the picture below.

1. Add new changes to a repository

2. Commit the change

3. Push the change to the repository

4. Pull the code from the repository

5. Merge local code into the remote repository

6. Create feature branch in a repository
